# Java
On this repo I will try to gather everything I know or want to know about java.
I'm principally doing this for me, so that I have a place to summarize what I'm learning.
There will be errors, because I'm no expert and still learning.
But if you can also learn something from this, that's great.
Feel free to comment and tell me if you see something that has to be changed.
